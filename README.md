> *This package allows you to install Dex quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.
This Yunohost package will install Dex and setup a canonical OpenID Connect provider for your Yunohost instance, based on the LDAP user base, that can then be used as an authentification server for other Yunohost apps.

### Features

- Fully working OpenID Connect authentification flow
- Interfaced with Yunohost's LDAP server


**Shipped version:** 2.35.0~ynh1 *(:warning: This is the `ci-auto-update-v2.35.0` branch. The [`master` branch](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/dex_ynh/tree/master) used in the catalog is currently on version 2.34.0\~ynh1.)*

## Disclaimers / important information

### Known limitations :

   * Only tested on x86 architectures
   * Dex only allows you to setup one OpenID Connect app at a time
   * However, it's a working multi-instance app, so you can install it more than once
   * Dex is only an OIDC provider, and user management will depend on the app using it as an OIDC provider

### To be used carefully :

   * Changing URL will work but will require some settings change in the app using Dex as an OIDC provider
   * Going to the URL will only let you see a "This is where Dex is installed." message
