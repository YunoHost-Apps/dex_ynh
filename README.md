> *This package allows you to install Dex quickly and simply on a YunoHost server.
If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.*

## Overview

Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive authentication for other apps.
This YunoHost package will install Dex and setup a canonical OpenID Connect provider for your YunoHost instance, based on the LDAP user base, that can then be used as an authentification server for other YunoHost apps.

### Features

- Fully working OpenID Connect authentification flow
- Interfaced with YunoHost's LDAP server


**Shipped version:** 2.35.3~ynh2

## Disclaimers / important information

### Known limitations:

   * Only tested on x86 architectures
   * Dex only allows you to setup one OpenID Connect app at a time
   * However, it's a working multi-instance app, so you can install it more than once
   * Dex is only an OIDC provider, and user management will depend on the app using it as an OIDC provider

### To be used carefully:

   * Changing URL will work but will require some settings change in the app using Dex as an OIDC provider
   * Going to the URL will only let you see a "This is where Dex is installed." message
