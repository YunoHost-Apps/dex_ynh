Dex for YunoHost has been revamped in v2.42.1~ynh4.

The app now only supports one instance per server, but can receive several configuration files to offer OIDC for multiple apps.
In YunoHost's catalog, only Outline and Headscale use Dex: they need to be upgraded along with it.

To ensure a smooth upgrade, please make sure only one instance of Dex remains on your server, with ID `dex`.
You must remove other instances, with IDs like `dex__n`.
